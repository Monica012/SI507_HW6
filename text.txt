What does a code comment look like in JavaScript? What character/s do you have to put before a comment?

Explain what needs to happen to get a JavaScript program to "run", given the JavaScript you've seen in this assignment.



What functions in JavaScript seem to be similar in function to the print function in Python? (There are two.) Why might you use one and not the other? Explain briefly.



What code would have to comment out to get rid of the pop-up box when you load the page? (Related to the last question.) Do that in the code file, and then, add code so that a text box will appear that contains the current date and time! HINT: Look through the rest of the code first...

How can you put your own name at the top where it currently says "A name"? Explain very briefly how to do so, and replace A name in the web page with your own name.

What does the word document represent in this code? Explain briefly.

What is happening in line 12 ( document.querySelector('#items').innerHTML = document.getElementsByTagName('li').length )? Explain, briefly (<= 2 sentences).

What color would the background of this page be if there were no JavaScript in this page?

Why are there a couple of gray boxes on the screen with a different colored border? How could you edit this code to make them a different color? Explain briefly. Then edit the code to make those boxes some shade of blue, of your choosing.

Edit the code so that, if you highlight McGill University and copy it, you see the text O Canada near the bottom of the page. Briefly explain why you made the edits that you did -- how did you know/figure out what to do?

In the original code, when you click the button that says Wow, you see a text box! Wow. Explain briefly in your own words why the following code causes that to happen:

function handleClick(){
	alert("hello");
}
and

<button onclick=handleClick() id="wow-button">Wow</button>
Knowing what you learned from the previous question, add code/markup to the jsPracticeLab.html file so that there is a button with the text Spring Equinox 2019 on it somewhere on the page, and when that button is clicked, a text box containing the text March 20, 2019 appears. (There's no function -- that I am aware of -- to automatically get this info, you've got to type it yourself.)
